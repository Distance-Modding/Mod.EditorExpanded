# List of Features (* are toggleable)

 - Shows dev music IDs in the track list*
 - Adds custom objects subfolders detection
 - Displays workshop level files in the level editor open file window*

# KNOWN ISSUES
 - Level Settings has a Transform field. (Editing these values do nothing, this should be hidden)
 - When changing the position of objects within a selected group, the outline glow may become misaligned.
